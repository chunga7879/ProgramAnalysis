# Milestone 1

### Ideas for Program Analysis

* Detecting memory leak in java
* Tracking garbage collecting in java
* Showing a call graph (or sequence diagram) for a method to visualize how the method would go through and its other calls to methods
  * Could expand on JUNIT 
    * Perhaps with some form of annotation
  * Call graph method properties displayed:
    * Runtime (how long it takes to execute)
    * Call graph
    * Parameters called with the method; maybe the object the method is called on too
* Checking possible values for variable statistically (null, int, string, etc) and any errors

### Follow up-tasks
* Decide what program analysis we will do among the ideas
* What specific features do our analysis need to have?
* Decide what responsibilities/roles/tasks we need and who will get the responsibilities
* Determine tech stack (language + libraries)

### TA Feedback
* More think about what extend it can support
* Need to have Useful visualization => more features (how many visualization we can have)
* Doing something interesting in run time like histogram
